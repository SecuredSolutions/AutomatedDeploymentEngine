# mtrade
The **L**ockheed **M**artin **A**utomated **D**eployment **E**ngine (mtrade) is a conceptual framework created by Edd Douse.
 
The purpose of this framework is to standardise the approach to automating the delivery of Infrastructure as a Service deployments 
both On-Premises and in the Cloud.


## mtrade Team
The current team working on the mtrade framework is:

Edd Douse (Me) - Infrastructure Consultant (Cloud Services) from the Coventry Office
Carl Clarke - Senior Infrastructure Enginer (DevOps), also from the Conventry Office


## The Work
Currently, mtrade comprised mainly of PowerShell script and Desired State Configuration (DSC) resources. 

For ease, this work is held in this single repository but ordered into Projects under a single Visual Studio Solution.  
**This project may move away from Solution files in the near future to allow easier contributions from non Visual Studio environments**


## Source Control
This project is using Git as the version control system: Using Git allows for easier distribution, editing, and contribution compared to TSVC.

Only the core team will have access to make changes in the Master branch, but anyone is welcome to clone this repository and make their own contribution.
When done with your work, submit a pull request: This will be reviewed by the core team and, if successful, the changes will be merged into the master branch.


Please take the time to review the [Coding and Design Standards document](Standards.md)
